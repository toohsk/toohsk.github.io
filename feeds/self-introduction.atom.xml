&lt;p&gt;Hi there! Thanks for visiting my personal blog!&lt;br&gt;
I'm Atsushi Hara from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been an engineer for about 8 years (since April, 2012) and specialize in data engineering and machine learning.&lt;br&gt;
I have a strong interest in bringing MLOps, deep learning and reinforcement learning into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probablly I'll write my carrer someday lol and put the link to this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What's this blog about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decieded to start my new career at &lt;a href="https://nature.global/"&gt;Nature Inc.&lt;/a&gt; as a data engineer and data scientist, so I decied to start a new personal blog.&lt;br&gt;
As I mentioned above, I'm really interested in bringing deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques into the real world, so I'll leave a note what I've studied or findings as a post.&lt;br&gt;
I hope these notes will help somebody, someday, I hope these notes will help somebody, someday, somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also I'll be posting about my hobbies as living proof.
Of course, needless to say, this blog is my personal opinion and not the opinion of the company I belong to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="self-introduction"></category><category term="self-introduction"></category></entry></feed>
