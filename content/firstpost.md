# Hello, World!

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my personal blog!<br>
I'm Atsushi Hara from Japan.

I have been an engineer for about 8 years (since April, 2012) and specialize in data engineering and machine learning.<br>
I have a strong interest in bringing MLOps, deep learning and reinforcement learning into the real world.

Probablly I'll write my carrer someday lol and put the link to this page.

# What's this blog about?

I've decieded to start my new career at [Nature Inc.](https://nature.global/) as a data engineer and data scientist, so I decied to start a new personal blog.<br>
As I mentioned above, I'm really interested in bringing deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques into the real world, so I'll leave a note what I've studied or findings as a post.<br>
I hope these notes will help somebody, someday, I hope these notes will help somebody, someday, somewhere!

And also I'll be posting about my hobbies as living proof.
Of course, needless to say, this blog is my personal opinion and not the opinion of the company I belong to.
